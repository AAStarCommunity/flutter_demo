# HexagonWarrior
Hexagon Warrior is a Web3 Mobile Application template in Flutter for the Ethereum ecosystem. 

It is a mobile application template integrating Ethereum AA account creation, D2FA security verification, Comet ENS, and ERC20 payment for purchasing digital assets with Web3 integration. The application allows creators to create and sell digital assets. It is open-source and available for anyone to use, with support for Ethereum ERC4337 integration, configurable Bundler and Paymaster, zero gas payment, and future support for EIP7702 and RIP7560.


We will focus on six areas to help Ethereum to build the human digital future:
**UX**(7-to-1 step easy to use), **Cost**(zero cross-chain cost and anonymous), **Security**(for users with your fingerprint), **Integration**(all you need abilities), **Fast**(to dev), **Community**(open-source and free for all communities).
